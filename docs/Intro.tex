\section{New Problem Space}
Deep Learning models non-linear patterns of data. This opens up a new range of problems to solve. 

\section{The steps}
The most important pieces, mathematically, are \textit{forward} and \textit{backward} propagation. They consist in calculating the cost and updating parameters, respectively.

\begin{itemize}
\item Forward: Compute Loss and Cost. 
\item Backward: Minimize cost, we need to derive it, and find a way to move towards the minimum. We use \textit{Gradient Descent}.
\end{itemize}
